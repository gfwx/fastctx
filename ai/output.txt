Introduction
1.1
Abstract
82% of individuals drop out of competitive sports between the ages of 15 to 18 years in India; Shiva
Keshavan says athletes resort to crowdfunding due to lack of funds — headlines you read in India,
the world’s soon-to-be 3rd largest economy.
The problem we want to solve is twofold: the lack of funding for the right athletes to advance
their careers in various sports at the right time. Second, sports in India is bigger than cricket. We
want to package athlete sponsorships as a marketing tool that helps homegrown brands
position themselves better.
1.2
Business Idea
TalentedASF is an athlete management tool that helps package athlete sponsorship
deals for small to medium-sized businesses to minimize sponsorship risk.
1.3
How it works
• Athletes create a profile on the platform - highlighting their statistics, sponsorship requirements,
guaranteed deliverables
• We manually rank athletes behind-the-scenes on objective and subjective factors that would
help inform sponsors on a clear decision.
• Based on sponsor requirements, we package athletes into sponsorship bundles which align to
the sponsor’s brand and deliverable requirements.
• We handle all communication and brokering between athletes and sponsors.
• We take a 12% success fee from the total sponsorship amount from each athlete.
1.4
Problem Prevalence
1. Grassroots athletes come with a high investment risk from a stakeholder’s perspective due to
many uncertainties:
(a) An athlete’s physical capability after X years.
(b) Intrinsic potential / talent of a given athlete
(c) Opportunities to compete in championships.
2. Brand activation is solely dependent on the athlete’s ability to sell the brand through personal
brand and/or career advancement.
4
talentedASF
3. The demands of athletes are too large for sole sponsors, leaving them to appease large brands
that already work with massive marketing budgets and plans.
4. Underdeveloped digital media channels and low media coverage lead to lower audience reach.
1.5
Our Difference Factor
We’re applying a new model of packaging athletes from different fields of play together to solve the
core problem of sponsorships - namely the risk of putting a large amount of money into a
single athlete and invariably bringing down the threshold for a business to look into sponsoring
athletes as a marketing expense.
1.6
Objectives and Goals
1.6.1
Objective
To build a platform that:
• Gets rising sports talent the access they need to financial stakeholders.
• Makes athlete sponsorships into safer, enticing investment opportunities for SMBs and large
businesses alike.
1.6.2
Goals (In order)
1. Identify at least 30 high-value proposition (from a sponsor perspective) athletes from a specific
field of sports initially.
2. Crack at least INR 5 Lakh worth of sponsorship deals for our athletes.
3. Prove our model of diversifying investment works better for both athletes and sponsors.
4. Diversify talent acquisition to at least 3 different fields of sports.

Literature Review
2.1
Market Landscape
• The Indian sports sponsorship industry has experienced significant growth in recent years. In
2022, total sports sponsorship expenditure reached INR 5,907 crore, marking a 105% increase
from 2021, and has increased by 24% in 2023 to a figure of INR 7,343 crore. [1]
• Cricket dominates 79% of sponsorship spending through ground, team and franchise fees in
India, with emerging sports claiming the other 21%. [1]
• India presents the most dramatic shift in progression of athlete support between upcoming
and elite athletes. For the 2024 Paris Olympics, Elite performers like Neeraj Chopra (Javelin
Throw), Chirag Shetty (Badminton) and PV Sindhu (Badminton) received INR 5.72, 5.62 and
3.13 crore in training funds respectively, whereas allocations for developing athletes like Dhindhi
Desinghu (Swimming) received INR 10.87 lakh, less than 2% of what the aforementioned elite
athletes received. [2]
• Close to 82% of individuals drop out of competitive sport in the age groups of 15-18 years. [3]
• In India, foundational financial support for young athletes comes majorly through the Khelo
India Scheme, which provides assistance of INR 6.28 Lakh per annum [4]. This is inadequate
for the following reasons:
1. Structured only to cover basic training expenses but falls short of the increasing expenses
of athletes as they progress in their careers
2. It is a one-size-fits-all solution that does not account for the disparity in spending across
all fields of sport.
• Traditional sectors, namely Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), Telecom, and Financial
businesses, maintain a substantial investment in sports sponsorships.
However, there is a
dramatic growth emerging from new-age tech startups and consumer technology businesses
and therefore a greater focus on capturing a younger, more technologically engaged population
through digital / social media. [5]
2.2
Competitor Analysis
2.2.1
Direct Sponsorship Platforms
OpenSponsorship
• OpenSponsorship runs an online platform where right holders— athletes, teams, leagues, and
their agents— can publish profiles for free. Brands can search the platform and publish anony-
mous requests for proposals detailing their marketing needs.

2.2.2
Indirect - Athlete Management
TRP Sports
• TRP Sports is one of the biggest athlete management companies in India, with a majority stake
in Indian football athletes. They provide a variety of services ranging from sports marketing
to athlete sponsorships and brand endorsements.
• TRP primarily makes money from sports player auctions as opposed to direct sponsorships,
invariably focusing on team-based sports as opposed to individual sports, however they have a
limited focus on the latter.
Meraki Sport and Entertainment
• Meraki operates across multiple verticals, including strategic advisory, experiential marketing,
digital and content marketing, franchise management, and athlete management. They special-
ize in representing non-cricket athletes such as such as Olympic gymnast Dipa Karmakar and
Paralympic Gold Medallist Devendra Jhajharia.
• Meraki opts purely for fewer long-term partnerships over short-term opportunities.
• Additionally, they depend heavily on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds to scout
and sponsor athletes - akin to a modern Venture Capital (VC) fund model.

Addressable Market Gaps
1. Identifying high-potential transition-stage athletes through talent scouts and subject-matter
experts.
2. Catering to SMBs and heavily funded, digital-first businesses.
3. Short-term / quid-pro-quo sponsorships that are based on fixed media / brand deliverables.

Business Model

Product Brief
Figure 1: An extremely brief summary of our value chain
Athletes: This represents individual athletes whom either we scout, or come to us directly.
Athletes provide us with data.
talentedASF: This represents us, the platform that facilitates the deal between sponsors and
athletes.
Sponsors: This represents the stakeholders, who fund our end consumer. We take a cut of
the final brokered deal between stakeholders and athletes.
• A web-hosted platform that aggregates athlete data (via a thorough onboarding experience)
and groups athletes based on their sport, accomplishments, targets and sponsorship needs.
• Features a public front which displays athletes in ”cards” - highlighting their biodata and career
record.
• Features a protected front which does matchmaking between stakeholders and athlete groups.
• The protected front is accessible only by the platform, making talentedASF the broker between
athletes and sponsors.
3.2
Revenue Streams
3.2.1
Direct Sponsorship Cut
• We take a direct cut of 12%, of the overall sponsorship, from the athlete’s end. This means
that, for a sponsor that commits X, an athlete gets 0.88 * X.
• Why 12%: Initially, we want to undercut the current sponsorship market to entice athletes to
work with us. As the platform offers better value, the sponsorship cut will reflect accordingly
to match the improvised value.

3.2.2
Athlete Management Services
• Provide athletes with media services post-sponsorship deal to ensure deliverables to ensure
sponsorships are activated effectively.
• This service varies from athlete-athlete, but we would charge an average of INR 30-50,000 based
on a monthly retainer model and fixed deliverables according to sponsor needs.
3.3
Key Assumptions
3.3.1
A diversified sponsorship deal will yield greater returns for a sponsor.
• It’s a novel way to approach sponsorships, and therefore will attract skepticism, especially when
large transactions are involved.
3.3.2
The market beyond cricket, in India, has potential for growth.
• Athlete sponsorship spending in India is currently dominated by cricket, which accounts for
more than 3 quarters of yearly spending as of 2023.
• We believe that as a result, most sports fraternities are severely underrepresented and lack the
overarching roadmap that cricket has.
